### Chrome app for thinkcopter

Reads data from mindflex or neurosky headset via serial port

→ Forwards data to thinkcopter.com, which sends commands to a drone based on
  brain activity level
  
→ Browser displays a graph with brain activity

Uses [browser-serialport](https://github.com/garrows/browser-serialport) to
read serialport data.

*Todo* 

→ Brain data is stored to a database _(what are we using it for?)_


# Build Project:

```
gulp build
```
